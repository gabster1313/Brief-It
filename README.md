# Brief-It

## Brief Web App 
### About
Brief It is a site for creatives to get inspired. It will have weekly briefs where users can come and create something new for their portfolios or just to hone in on their skills. Brief It is inspired by the Instagram community of creatives and similar pages that offer real briefs for real creatives.

### How it works
Weekly, a new brief will be manually populated on the home page. For users to participate, they can go onto the 'Talent Show'part of the site and upload their work from previous briefs. The uploader will store the images, and I will check them on the back-end to make sure there are no inappropriate submissions. Users can also visit the archive page and flip through the tabs to find various kinds of briefs to get inspired by.
